# Channels

## Think of channels as doors ðŸšª

- Unbuffered channel = a door that can only be opened if both people (sender + receiver) are at the door at the same time.

- Buffered channel (size N) = a door with a small waiting room inside. Sender can drop things in the room until itâ€™s full, then they must wait. Receiver can come later and pick them up.
