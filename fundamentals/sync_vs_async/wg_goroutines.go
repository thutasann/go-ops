// In Go, synchronization means coordinating the execution of multiple goroutines so they donâ€™t:
// - Race over shared data, or
// - Exit too early before others finish.
// Since goroutines run concurrently, you need sync mechanisms to:
// - Ensure correct access to shared resources.
// - Wait for tasks to complete.
// - Control execution order when needed.
